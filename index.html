This is a replica of the mobile game flappy bird. This game has a temporary high score(the high score of the 
current session, when the page is reloaded or closed, the highscore goes back to 0), a pause screen for the user
and a screen that shows up at the end of the game. The bird gets controlled by the spacebar and pause screen is
activated by pressing "p".
